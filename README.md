# QUIZ-APP
 
This is a quiz app where users first have to sign up and log in to the site. After logging in, they have the option to create a room to participate in a quiz competition. Each room can accommodate two users. Once two users enter the room, it becomes full, and the quiz starts.

You will be given 5 questions, each with a duration of 10 seconds. If a user can't answer a question within 10 seconds, the quiz will move on to the next question. For each correct answer, you will earn 10 points. If you can't answer a question, you won't receive any points. After completing the quiz, you will see your total points and be redirected to the room listing screen, where the room you participated in will be automatically deleted.
